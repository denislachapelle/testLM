ex1p.cpp
Original MFEM-4.8 example.
Status: works fine.

ex1p_01.cpp
Add boundary condition on the square and circle, -1.0 and 1.0 using projectBrdCoefficient.
Status: Works fine.

ex1p_02.cpp
implement the same boundary conditions using Lagrange multipliers.
Status: Did not work.

ex1_03.cpp
implement the same boundary conditions using Lagrange multipliers and in ***serial*** mode.
Status: works fine.

ex1_04.cpp
same as ex1_03 with added simple dsmoother based block preconditioner.
Status: works fine.

ex1_05.cpp
same as ex1_04 with improved preconditioners selectable.
Status: works fine.

From this knowledge acquire I can return to transmission line 2D....
